# Random-Topographic-Structure-Creator-Demo-

## Basic Information
  &emsp; A Python program creating a random mountain or sinkhole. Pandas, random ,and plotly libraries are used. There was a problem with Numpy so lists are used instead. In upcoming original project many other libraries will be used ,and it will be well-organised.

   &emsp; Basically this program creates lists that keeping values of height of points on topographic structure. Lists are added nestedly. So it creates 2D data for keeping heights. Those values in 2D data are randomly created in an order that makes a mountain or a sinkhole. That makes being random less but creates structures more realistic. As a result of that, there is just one type of creation. More creation types are being developed by myself. There will be a complex project here soon.
  
 ## A Mountain Looks Like This:

 ## There Is a Contour Graph Of It Too:
